# Homework #2

## Overview

In this homework assignment, you will explore, analyze and model a data set containing approximately 2200
records. Each record represents a professional baseball team from the years 1871 to 2006 inclusive. Each record
has the performance of the team for the given year, with all of the statistics adjusted to match the performance of
a 162 game season.

Your objective is to build a multiple linear regression model on the training data to predict the number of wins
for the team. You can only use the variables given to you (or variables that you derive from the variables
provided).

## Deliverables:

A write-up submitted in PDF format. Your write-up should have four sections. Each one is described
below. You may assume you are addressing me as a fellow data scientist, so do not need to shy away
from technical details.

Assigned predictions (the number of wins for the team) for the evaluation data set.

Include your R statistical programming code in an Appendix.
