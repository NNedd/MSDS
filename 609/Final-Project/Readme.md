# TITLE

SATs and student demographic and enrollment data from the NYC Department of Education 2011 – 2016.

# ABSTRACT

Education is a very important topic in any society. One of the unique aspects that makes the US education
system so dynamic are the levels of diversity currently present in our public school systems. Over the past
decade, research at various levels in public and private sectors have determined that diversity is important to
success and it all starts with a person’s education.

This final project focused on NY City Public School demographic data and SAT Test scores in order to
determine the effects of a school’s student demographics on SAT scores. The data-set contains 8867 records
that encompass the entire school system. The variables for the data pertain to school demographic information
such as number of enrollments, school names, breakout by grade and percentages, but the SAT data is
only available for one of the 5 years. The purpose for this project is to analyze the data, perform any data
manipulation / clean-up and use two (2) methods learned in the class which in this case was a linear model
to predict SAT Scores (enhanced by employing a generalized model in R) and then difference equations to
predict the demographics for the year 2016-17 and then predict the SAT scores for that given year using the
improved demographic data. The final model provided an AIC = 3600.7.

The data was obtained from the NYC Open Data portal (data.cityofnewyork.us/).
